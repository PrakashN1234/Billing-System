## Adding New Users

To add a new user, update the `AUTHORIZED_USERS` object in `src/utils/roleManager.js`:

```javascript
export const AUTHORIZED_USERS = {
  'newuser@mystore.com': USER_ROLES.CASHIER,
  // Add more users as needed
};
```

## Customizing Permissions

Modify the `ROLE_PERMISSIONS` object to adjust what each role can access:

```javascript
export const ROLE_PERMISSIONS = {
  [USER_ROLES.CASHIER]: [
    'view_dashboard',
    'manage_billing',
    'view_inventory'
    // Add or remove permissions
  ]
};
```

The system provides secure, role-appropriate access while maintaining ease of use for each user type.
