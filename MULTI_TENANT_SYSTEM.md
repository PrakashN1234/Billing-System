  ]
};
```

## Navigation Structure

## Key Benefits

### 1. Clear Separation of Concerns
- **Super Admin**: Focuses on business expansion and user management
- **Admin**: Focuses on store operations and performance
- **Cashier**: Focuses on customer service and transactions

### 2. Data Security
- Super Admins cannot access sensitive sales data
- Admins cannot create users or stores
- Cashiers cannot access historical sales data

### 3. Role-Appropriate Interfaces
- Each role sees only relevant information
- Simplified interfaces reduce confusion
- Better user experience for each role type

### 4. Scalable Architecture
- Easy to add new stores and users
- Clear hierarchy and responsibilities
- Flexible permission system

This structure ensures that each user type has access only to the features they need for their specific role, improving security and user experience.

## Data Isolation

### Store-Based Filtering
All data is filtered based on user's store assignment:

```javascript
// Super Admin - sees all data
const salesData = await getSalesByStore(null, 50); // null = all stores

// Store Admin/Cashier - sees only their store's data
const salesData = await getSalesByStore(userStoreId, 50);
```

### Database Structure
Each document includes a `storeId` field for proper data isolation:

```javascript
// Inventory Item
{
  id: "product_123",
  name: "Rice 1kg",
  price: 50,
  stock: 100,
  storeId: "store_001", // Associates with specific store
  createdAt: timestamp,
  updatedAt: timestamp
}

// Sales Record
{
  id: "sale_456",
  items: [...],
  total: 500,
  storeId: "store_001", // Associates with specific store
  timestamp: timestamp
}
```

## User Management

### Authorization Structure
```javascript
export const AUTHORIZED_USERS = {
  // Super Admin (Company Level)
  'nprakash315349@gmail.com': { 
    role: 'super_admin', 
    storeId: null, // null = access to all stores
    storeName: 'Company Admin'
  },
  
  // Store Admin (Store Level)
  'admin@store1.com': { 
    role: 'admin', 
    storeId: 'store_001', 
    storeName: 'Main Store'
  },
  
  // Cashier (Store Level)
  'cashier@store1.com': { 
    role: 'cashier', 
    storeId: 'store_001', 
    storeName: 'Main Store'
  }
};
```

### Adding New Users
Only Super Admins can add new users through the system:

1. Navigate to Users section (only visible to Super Admin)
2. Click "Add User"
3. Assign role and store
4. User gets access only to their assigned store's data

### Adding New Stores
Only Super Admins can create new stores:

1. Navigate to Stores section (only visible to Super Admin)
2. Click "Add Store"
3. Configure store details
4. Assign users to the new store

## Security Features

### Access Control
- **Route-level protection**: Users can only access views they have permissions for

- **UI restrictions**: Navigation items are filtered based on role and permissions

### Store Isolation
- Store Admins cannot see other stores' data

- Inventory is filtered by store
- User management is restricted to Super Admins

## Dashboard Differences

### Super Admin Dashboard

- **System management**: User creation, store creation, system tools
- **All-store access**: Can view and manage data from any store

### Store Admin Dashboard

- **No user management**: Cannot create users or access other stores

### Cashier Dashboard

### 4. Business Logic

## Technical Implementation

### Key Functions
- `getUserStoreId(email)`: Get user's assigned store
- `canAccessStore(email, storeId)`: Check store access permissions
- `filterDataByStoreAccess(email, data)`: Filter data by store access
- `subscribeToInventoryByStore(storeId)`: Real-time store-specific data

### Database Queries
All queries include store filtering:
```javascript
// Firestore query with store filter
query(collection(db, 'inventory'), where('storeId', '==', userStoreId))
```

This multi-tenant system ensures proper data isolation while maintaining a seamless user experience for each role level.
